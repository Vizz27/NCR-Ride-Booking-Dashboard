Tableau Public Link : https://public.tableau.com/views/NCRRIDEBOOKINGSDASHBOARD/NCRRIDEDASHBOARD?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
Built an interactive dashboard analyzing 150k+ ride-booking records from the NCR region to surface demand patterns, peak hours, vehicle-type performance, and the top drivers of cancellations. Dashboard features KPI overview, time-series, hour-of-day heatmap, cancellation-reason breakdown, top pickup hotspots, and ratings distributions. Tools: Tableau, Excel.
Key insights: Peak cancellations occur between 18:00–20:00 with “No Driver Found” as a leading cause; premium vehicles show higher booking value; a few neighborhoods account for most demand.
